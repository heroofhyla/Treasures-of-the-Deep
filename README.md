"The Deep" (name subject to change) is a game developed with Godot, created as
part of the [Submarine Jam](https://itch.io/jam/submarine-jam).

The game is a work of progress, and I'm not really sure where I want to go with
it from here. My instinct is that I want to make it a metroidvania, but I can't
think of any good abilities to unlock that would allow progress. So far you can
unlock a floodlight (makes eye monsters recoil and helps you see in the dark)
and a sonar that you can ping to unlock doors (with different security codes).
