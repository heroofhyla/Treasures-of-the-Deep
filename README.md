This is a game created in Godot as part of the [Submarine
Jam](https://itch.io/jam/submarine-jam). The game is still very much a work in
progress, and I don't really know where I want to go with it yet. All I have so
far is basic movement controls and a little feature that makes the screen darken
as you go deeper - but you can turn on a flashlight!
